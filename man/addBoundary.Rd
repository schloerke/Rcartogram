\title{addBoundary
Embed matrix within larger matrix}
\usage{
addBoundary(pop, sea = 2, land.mean = mean(unlist(pop)))

\S4method{addBoundary}{ANY}(pop, sea = 2, land.mean = mean(unlist(pop)))
}
\arguments{
\item{pop}{the matrix of densities/counts to be embedded.}

\item{sea}{a number which is applied to the dimensions of the original matrix to determine how many rows and columns should be added to the original matrix. Twice as many rows and columns are added as this product, an equal number of rows above and below, and an equal  number of columns to the left and to the right.}

\item{land.mean}{the scalar value that we use as the value for the cells we with which we surround the existing matrix. This is the value for all the cells in the sea region.}
}
\value{
A matrix with dimension \code{ floor((1 + 2 * seq) * dim(pop)) } and whose "outer" values in the added rows #' is the mean of the original matrix \code{pop}.
}
\description{
This function is useful for taking the grid of
densities/counts as a matrix and embedding
 it in a larger matrix whose additional values
are just the mean of our original matrix.
This new matrix can then be handed to
\code{\link{cartogram}} to fit the
diffusion cartogram. The extra "padding" or "sea"
helps the algorithm converge.
}
\examples{
m = matrix(1, 5, 7)
mm = col(m)

ex = addBoundary(mm)
dim(ex)
image(ex)

ex = addBoundary(mm, 1)
